# CakePHP Sakila Plugin

[![Latest Version on Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/cnizzardini/cakephp-sakila-plugin.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/cnizzardini/cakephp-sakila-plugin)

This Cake 4 plugin comes with a snapshot and data seeds for the 
[MySQL Sakila Sample Data](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/sakila/en/). I found myself needing test data when I am creating
new plugins and wanted something with complex enough relations for realistic development.

## Install

```bash
composer require cnizzardini/cakephp-sakila-plugin
bin/cake plugin load Sakila
```

Alternatively after composer installing you can manually load the plugin in your Application:

```php
# src/Application.php
public function bootstrap(): void
{
    // other logic...
    $this->addPlugin('Sakila');
}
```

## Usage

Run migrate and seed with `-p Sakila`

```bash
bin/cake migrations migrate -p Sakila
bin/cake migrations seed -p Sakila
```

## Baking

You should now be able to bake a full application skeleton

```bash
bin/cake bake all --everything
```

Verify everything is working by running `bin/cake server`

## Schema

See [config/Migrations/20200422015732_Initial.php](config/Migrations/20200422015732_Initial.php) for full schema.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests ensure the schema can be built and seeders run. It uses `cakephp/migrations` and SQLite for the data store.

```bash
vendor/bin/phpunit
```
